# Yape

Yet Another PiP Extension. 

Yape does very simple thing: finds all HTML5 videos on a webpage and allows you to play them in Picture-in-Picture mode. Just click on an item from the list and this video will be switched to Picture-in-Picture mode.

Basically, this is very similar extension to [PiPifier](https://github.com/arnoappenzeller/PiPifier) and [PiedPiPer](https://github.com/JoeKuhns/PiedPiPer.safariextension), which I discovered in the middle of development. The main difference is that Yape doesn't add any buttons to the webpage. Instead, you enable Picture-in-Picture mode from Safari toolbar. 

## Requirements

1. Safari 10.0+
